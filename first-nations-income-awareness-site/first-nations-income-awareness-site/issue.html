      <h1>Low income is shaped by systems—especially colonial systems—not individual choices.</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        When people don’t have enough income, they may be deprived of the resources and choices needed to meet basic needs and participate in society.
        For many First Nations communities, low income is tied to policies and decisions that restricted land, governance, mobility, and economic opportunities.

          <h2 style="margin-top:0">What does “poverty” mean in Canada?</h2>
          <p>
            The Government of Canada describes poverty as being <em>deprived of the resources, means, choices, and power</em> needed to maintain basic living standards
            and participate in society.
          </p>
          <div class="note">
            <strong>Key idea:</strong> poverty is not only “money.” It also involves access to safe housing, food, education, health care, and community wellbeing.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card pad soft">
          <h2 style="margin-top:0">Low income in Canada (2021)</h2>
          <p>
            In 2021, <strong>18.8%</strong> of Indigenous people lived in a low-income household compared with <strong>10.7%</strong> of the non-Indigenous population.
          </p>
          <p class="badge">Why this matters</p>
          <p>
            Low income limits choices. It can mean fewer options for safe housing, transportation to medical care, healthy food, school supplies, and stable internet—each linked to quality of life.

      <h2>How colonial systems created long-term barriers</h2>
      <div class="grid two">
        <div class="card pad soft">
          <h3>Colonial policy restricted economic participation</h3>
          <p>
            Colonial laws and practices—including the <strong>Indian Act (1876)</strong> and related policies—controlled governance and community life in ways that disrupted
            economies and limited opportunities. These restrictions did not “disappear”; they shaped the conditions people inherited.
          </p>
          <div class="note">
            <strong>Systemic → intergenerational:</strong> when communities are prevented from building wealth, infrastructure, or stable services over generations,
            today’s income gaps are a predictable outcome.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="card pad soft">
          <h3>Income gaps are documented</h3>
          <p>
            Research has found large income gaps where non-Indigenous people work on reserves compared with First Nations workers, especially in rural settings.
          </p>
          <p>
            These gaps reflect structural issues (access, investment, geography, discrimination, policy), not individual effort.
